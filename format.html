        <P class="text">
            Farming is a major occupation in India and involves several important steps to grow crops successfully. The main stages include soil preparation, sowing, irrigation and crop care, and harvesting.

            First, the soil is prepared by ploughing and leveling the land. This loosens the soil, improves air flow, and removes weeds and stones, creating a good environment for seeds to grow.

            Next is sowing, where seeds are planted at the right depth and spacing. The timing of sowing depends on the type of crop and local climate. For example, kharif crops like rice are sown during the monsoon, while rabi crops like wheat are sown in winter. Using good-quality seeds helps increase crop yield.

            After sowing, crops need water, nutrients, and protection. Irrigation provides the necessary water, and fertilizers add nutrients to the soil. Farmers also protect crops from pests and diseases using pesticides and remove weeds regularly.

            Finally, when the crops mature, harvesting is done by cutting and collecting them. After harvesting, crops are processed and stored properly.

            These steps, followed carefully, help farmers produce healthy crops and support India’s food needs.

            <h2 class="head">SOIL PREPARATION </h2>
        </div>
        <P class="text">
            Soil preparation is the first and most important step in farming.<br> It involves loosening and turning the soil to create a good environment for seeds to grow.<br> Properly prepared soil improves air circulation, water retention, and nutrient absorption by plants.<br><br>

            Traditionally, farmers in India used bullocks to plough the fields, but now tractors are widely used for faster and deeper tilling.<br> After ploughing, the land is leveled to ensure even irrigation and prevent waterlogging.<br> Leveling also helps in uniform seed sowing.<br><br>

            Weeds, stones, and other debris are removed during this process to avoid competition with crops.<br> Farmers often add organic manure or fertilizers to improve soil fertility and provide essential nutrients for healthy plant growth.<br><br>

            Soil testing is becoming more common to analyze nutrient levels and pH, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about fertilization.<br> Proper soil preparation ultimately leads to better seed germination, stronger plants, and higher crop yields.

            <h2 class="head">SOWING </h2>
        </div>
        <P class="text">
            Sowing is the process of planting seeds in prepared soil.<br> It is a crucial step that determines the success of the crop.<br> Proper sowing ensures good seed germination and healthy plant growth.<br><br>

            The timing of sowing depends on the type of crop and the local climate.<br> For example, kharif crops like rice are sown with the onset of the monsoon, while rabi crops like wheat are planted in winter.<br> Choosing the right season helps crops grow better and produce higher yields.<br><br>

            Farmers use different methods of sowing, such as broadcasting seeds by hand, drilling seeds in rows, or transplanting seedlings.<br> Proper spacing during sowing is important to avoid overcrowding and ensure each plant gets enough sunlight, water, and nutrients.<br><br>

            Using high-quality seeds improves crop resistance to pests and diseases and leads to better production.<br> Overall, careful sowing sets the foundation for a successful harvest.

            <h2 class="head">IRRIGATION AND CROP CARE</h2>
        </div>
        <P class="text">
            Irrigation is the process of supplying water to crops to help them grow, especially when rainfall is insufficient.<br> It ensures that plants receive the right amount of moisture at different stages of growth.<br><br>

            In India, common irrigation methods include canals, tube wells, drip irrigation, and sprinklers.<br> Efficient irrigation helps increase crop yield and protects plants from drought stress.<br><br>

            Crop care involves protecting plants from weeds, pests, and diseases.<br> Farmers use weeding, fertilizers, and pesticides to maintain healthy crops.<br> Regular monitoring and timely care prevent damage and improve productivity.<br><br>

            Together, proper irrigation and crop care create favorable conditions for strong plant growth and a successful harvest.

            <h2 class="head">HARVESTING</h2>
        </div>
        <P class="text">
            Harvesting is the process of collecting mature crops from the fields.<br> It is the final and most important step in farming.<br><br>

            Harvesting at the right time ensures good quality and maximum yield.<br> If done too early or late, crop quality and quantity suffer.<br><br>

            Traditionally, farmers use sickles, while modern farms use combine harvesters that cut, thresh, and clean in one go.<br><br>

            After cutting, crops are threshed to separate grains from stalks, either manually or mechanically.<br><br>

            Grains are then cleaned and dried to prevent spoilage during storage.<br><br>

            Proper harvesting and storage reduce losses and impact the farmer’s income and food supply.
